            <h2>1.FIND THE BEST CODE EDITOR</h2>
            <p>Developer productivity starts with a good source code editor. Although there are many great options in the market, itâ€™s hard to tell which is the best one â€” it all depends on your goals and needs. Itâ€™s worth trying out different code editors to see which one fits best with your workflow. Here are some important things to take into considerationâ€¦</p>

             <ul>
                 <li>Which programming language(s) you are using. You need a code editor that offers syntax highlighting for the languages you need (at least as a plugin). Some code editors also come with syntax highlighters for popular technologies such as React, not only for programming languages.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li>If your chosen code editor has an adequate theme and plugin ecosystem that provides the functionality you need (for instance, a high contrast theme if you have low vision).</li>
                 <br>
                 <li>If you commit your work to a code sharing platform, such as GitHub or Bitbucket, you might find built-in Git functionality useful. For instance, Visual Studio Code lets you directly commit your work to GitHub without leaving the editor.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li>If you want to use your own code snippets and/or keyboard shortcuts, itâ€™s also a good idea to pick a code editor that lets you add or import them.</li>

            <h2>2. START WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK EVERY DAY</h2>
            <p>Itâ€™s easy to get lost in daily tasks and procrastination is also a common habit of developers â€” especially, if you work as a freelancer and have to manage your own deadlines. Therefore, it frequently happens that you work all day and by the end of the day, you realize that you have barely accomplished anything. You can avoid that if, rather than multitasking, you create a hierarchy of daily tasks and start with the most difficult task every day</p>

            <h2>3. TAKE BREAKS REGULARLY</h2>
            <p>Humans canâ€™t concentrate on the same thing for unlimited time and this is especially true of hard mental work such as programming. You can find different studies about the time limit people can focus on a task without their mind wandering off to something else. For example, this study states that sustained attention is possible for about 45 minutes, while another one mentions 52 consecutive minutes followed by a 17-minute break.<br><br>Then, we have the famous Pomodoro Technique that uses a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to measure time. It works with 25-minute time blocks with 5-minute short breaks and 10-minute long breaks. The Pomodoro Technique has become so popular with the developer community that there are even Pomodoro apps you can use while working.<br><br>All in all, thereâ€™s no golden rule here, and everyone has a different time limit, so youâ€™ll need to experiment a bit to find out what works best for you. Itâ€™s also not worth following a very strict rule â€” if you are already in the flow, donâ€™t interrupt your work just because the time for the break has arrived.<br><br>However, thereâ€™s one important thing to remember. The break has to be a real break when you do get up from your desk. Checking emails, Slack notifications, social media, blogs, or just staring at any kind of screen wonâ€™t matter as a break for your brain â€” every single research on the subject states this as a fact.</p>
